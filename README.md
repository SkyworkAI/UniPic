## 📝 Overview

Welcome to the **Skywork-UniPic** repository!  
This repository hosts the **model weights** and **official implementations** of our unified multimodal models, featuring two distinct modeling paradigms:

- **UniPic-1.0** — *1.5B parameters*, **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation, enabling a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.  
- **UniPic-2.0 Series** — *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants based on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, delivering state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.
