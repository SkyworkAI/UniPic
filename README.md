## 📝 Overview

Welcome to the **Skywork-UniPic** repository!  
This repository hosts the **model weights** and **official implementations** of our unified multimodal models, featuring two distinct modeling paradigms:

- **UniPic-1.0** — *1.5B parameters*, **Unified Autoregressive Modeling** for joint visual understanding and generation, enabling a single transformer to handle both perception and synthesis tasks.  
- **UniPic-2.0 Series** — *SD3.5M-Kontext* and *MetaQuery* variants based on **Efficient Architectures** with **Diffusion Post-Training**, delivering state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, fine-grained image editing, and multimodal reasoning.

## ✨ Key Features
 
- 🎨 **Text-to-Image Generation** — High-fidelity synthesis from natural language prompts.  
- 🛠 **Image Editing** — Seamless inpainting, outpainting, and object manipulation.
- 🖼 **Image Understanding** — Robust perception capabilities for various visual tasks. 
- ⚡ **Efficient Architecture** — Optimized for both accuracy and deployability.
